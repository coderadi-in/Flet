# Day 7: Mini Project #1 - Simple To-Do App  
**Objective**: Build a basic To-Do app with task addition, removal, and completion checkmarks.  

---

## 🛠️ Features to Implement  
1. **Add Tasks**  
   - TextField for input + Button to submit.  
   - Tasks appear in a scrollable list.  
2. **Remove Tasks**  
   - Delete button (🗑️) for each task.  
3. **Check/Uncheck Tasks**  
   - Checkbox to mark tasks as complete (strikethrough text).  
4. **UI Styling**  
   - Use `Container`, `padding`, `margin`, and `border_radius` for polish.

## 📝 Key Concepts (Recap from Days 1-6)  
### 1. **Layout** (`Column`, `Row`)  
   - Tasks listed vertically (`Column`).  
   - Each task has a `Row` (Checkbox + Text + Delete Button).  

### 2. **Input Controls**  
   - `TextField` for task input.  
   - `Checkbox` for completion status.  

### 3. **Buttons & Events**  
   - `ElevatedButton` to add tasks (`on_click`).  
   - `IconButton` for delete action.  

### 4. **Styling**  
   - Use `padding/margin` for spacing.  
   - `border_radius` for rounded corners.
